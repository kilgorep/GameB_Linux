# GameB on Linux

I have been watching, with great interest, [Ryan Ries'](https://github.com/ryanries) [GameB series on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlaINRtydtNWuRfd4Ra3KeD6L9FP_tDE7) in which he develops a classic 8-bit style 2D open world RPG primarily using the C language and the Win32 API as opposed to an already developed game engine such as Unity or Unreal. Since as almost all of my own programming background has been rooted in a Linux environment, I've found the series particularly fascinating as an introduction to the [Win32 API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/) and seeing the Windows counterparts to concepts I'm already familiar with as a Linux programmer.

That being said, I've also grown increasingly interested in trying to recreate the project in Linux, so this repo represents that attempt. My initial plan for now is to document my progress episode by episode per the video series.
